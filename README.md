## Description

*When we started development of this project we first intended it to be a food delivery service app based on django with added bonus of features allwong for easier ordering for your friend or whole Team. After one week we realised that such app would be overkill and would require enourmous effort to be feasible for normal use. So we decided that we will gonna develop much smaller but more practical and "ready-to-use" solution that could be easily used even after the end of the competition. Luckly, we we're able to reuse a lot of code becouse we started development with front-end and our new much lighter framework (Flask) was able to render existing html templates without any major changes.*

## Protoype

*The project is still in prototype. We we're able to implement all mayor features. Users are able to share a link with their friends or team and vote who orders, from which restaurant the person orders and choose what they want to eat. In the future we would like to implement discord bot and app for smartphones that could speed up the process and make it more straight-forward. Also it would be helpfull if we would be able to add API of any major food delivery service becouse it would make the whole process much easier.*

## How to try

*List any URLs relevant to demonstrating your prototype, e.g. a live url where judges can preview your app. Note that judges won't be able to setup anything in their computers.*

## Challenges and accomplishments
*We learned a lot of things. We did a lot of mistakes too, but we are learning from mistakes. It took lot of time but we are proud of everything we did and learned.*

## Next steps

*We sure still have a long way to go. There are still plenty of things we don't know. We sure have to start think ahead.
