## Description

*When we started development of this project we first intended it to be a food delivery service app based on django with added bonus of features allwong for easier ordering for your friend or whole Team. After one week we realised that such app would be overkill and would require enourmous effort to be feasible for normal use. So we decided that we will gonna develop much smaller but more practical and "ready-to-use" solution that could be easily used even after the end of the competition. Luckly, we we're able to reuse a lot of code becouse we started development with front-end and our new much lighter framework (Flask) was able to render existing html templates without any major changes.*

## Protoype

*The project is still in prototype. We we're able to implement all mayor features. Users are able to share a link with their friends or team and vote who orders, from which restaurant the person orders and choose what they want to eat. In the future we would like to implement discord bot and app for smartphones that could speed up the process and make it more straight-forward. Also it would be helpfull if we would be able to add API of any major food delivery service becouse it would make the whole process much easier.*

## Challenges and accomplishments
*We learned a lot of things. We did a lot of mistakes too, but we are learning from our mistakes. This was our first collaboration on a project.*

## Next steps

*We sure still have a long way to go. There are still plenty of things not finished in here. We would like to add config, fix bugs, and re-code some bad parts of our code that largely happened to lack of time in our hands.*
